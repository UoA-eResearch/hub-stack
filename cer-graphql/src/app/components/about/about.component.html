  <p>The computational demands of today's research questions often require highly specialised computing and storage
    infrastructure, along with advanced software tools and services. The Centre for eResearch pioneers the development
    of such infrastructure and services on behalf of the University's research communities. We work hand-in-hand with
    researchers to help them leverage computational advances in pursuit of their own research questions. To this end we
    aim to provide sophisticated computing environments, advanced storage solutions for managing large research data
    collections, and a variety of productivity and community support software tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    The centre also plays a key role in providing leadership in eResearch at the national level, hosting both
    the BeSTGRID grid middleware and the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) at the University of Auckland.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our vision at the Centre for eResearch is to be a nationally and internationally influential community of eResearch
    practitioners, developers and thought leaders. We aim to excel in facilitating the research of others, as well as
    contributing to the evolving research themes within the field of eResearch itself.
